			The Fool plays by himself.

			(for example, pretending to be a mobster or a maniac). This is the only way he can win. 
			After he is executed, the game ends - all other participants lose. If the Fool is killed at night, he loses.
			The role of the Fool is available in automatic games without bots, which take place every hour.`,
